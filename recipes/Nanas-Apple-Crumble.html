    <h1>Nana's Apple Crumble</h1>
    <img src="../images/Nana's Apple Crumble.webp" alt="Nana's Apple Crumble">
    <p>A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which 
        my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends,
         or to potlucks. There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.</p>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>7 large Cortland apples - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
         <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
         <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Topping:</h3>
     <ul><li>cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup unsalted butter, cubed</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Directions</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
         <li>Spread apples in an even layer in a deep dish pie plate or 8-inch square glass casserole dish.
              Cover with white sugar, then top with cinnamon.</li>
         <li>Combine flour and brown sugar for topping in a bowl. Add butter and cut in with a pastry blender.
              Spread topping evenly over apple mixture and pat down.</li>
         <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apple mixture is bubbling and topping is browned, about 55 minutes.</li>
     </ol>
     <h2>Cook's Note:</h2> 
         <p>You will probably want to double this recipe for larger groups.
          If you do, you should increase the butter and the brown sugar in the topping by a tablespoon each.
          Bake in a 9x12-inch casserole dish.
